# fraud_detecton_using_LIGHTGBM
The Credit card fraud detection system is initiated for detecting the fraud transactions from the number of transactions made by the card holders. The transactions done by credit card holders are derived in the form of Kaggle datasets. Kaggle datasets are nothing but data that are already being posted by the companies and researchers for the purpose of machine learning and data mining.
The project is part of a research prediction competition on an online platform Kaggle namely IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection. The dataset we have used is provided by Vesta Corporation. The dataset consists of train and test data each having identity and transaction data files respectively. The identity dataset consists about 41 set of features and the transaction dataset consists of 394 set features. The dataset consists of highly imbalanced class and consisting of about only 1% of transactions as fraud.
An effective way to handle imbalanced data is to downsample and upweight the majority class.
